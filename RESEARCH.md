# Research notes: from open file dumps to citable IELTS datasets

This document records how the datasets behind the IELTS API were derived. It is written so that a
reviewer can reproduce, criticise or extend every step.

Two independent upstream collections are analysed:

| Part                                              | Upstream collection                                                                                   | Snapshot                       | What it yields                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Part I](#part-i--the-research-corpus)            | [`zhengyishiming/IELTS`](https://github.com/zhengyishiming/IELTS)                                     | commit `a9e2d6c9`, 404 blobs   | the vocabulary dataset and the corpus index                                      |
| [Part II](#part-ii--the-practice-test-collection) | [`ngoclong1209/UPGRADE-YOUR-IELTS-SKILLS`](https://github.com/ngoclong1209/UPGRADE-YOUR-IELTS-SKILLS) | commit `ba7a0f2b`, 6,309 blobs | the question-type taxonomy and the practice-test structure and readability index |
| [Part III](#part-iii--the-text-analysis-engine)   | _no new upstream collection; plus a review of_ [`Oxidaner/ielts`](https://github.com/Oxidaner/ielts)  | commit `738c6082`, 2,385 blobs | the deterministic text-analysis engine (`/v1/analyze/*`)                         |

Neither collection is redistributed. Both are indexed, measured and cited.

## Part I — the research corpus

**Corpus snapshot:** commit `a9e2d6c9a070eecea6ffaa6f15b2a00c1c7b938c` (2 September 2024, "Add files
via upload"), 78 commits, single branch `main`, 404 blobs, no tags, no licence file.

### 1. What the corpus actually contains

The repository is a flat dump of study material — one directory, 404 files, no code and no
metadata. Fetching the tree through the GitHub API and classifying by file type gives:

| Format                              | Files |
| ----------------------------------- | ----: |
| `.rar` (mostly multipart archives)  |   244 |
| `.epub`                             |    54 |
| `.pdf`                              |    52 |
| `.mp3`                              |    19 |
| `.mobi`                             |     9 |
| `.azw` / `.azw3`                    |     6 |
| `.mp4`                              |     3 |
| `.txt`                              |     3 |
| `.xlsx`                             |     2 |
| `.zip`                              |     2 |
| `.m3u`                              |     2 |
| other (`gds`, `jpg`, `php`, `docx`) |     4 |

The decisive observation is that **the corpus is not topic-homogeneous**. Keyword classification of
file names puts the 404 files into three groups:

1. **Semiconductor and micro-fabrication textbooks** — lithography, GaN HEMT processes, power
   devices, MCU industry reports (the single largest group, and the reason most `.rar` multipart
   archives exist).
2. **Music and media** — Chinese pop MP3s, IPTV playlists (`.m3u`), concert rips.
3. **Cryptocurrency** — _Mastering Bitcoin_ (English and Chinese), NFT guides, virtual-currency
   investment books.

Only **76 files (18.8%)** are IELTS or English-learning material; they account for 713 MB. That ratio
is the first contribution of this project: an unfiltered crawler would treat a semiconductor
textbook as IELTS training data.

### 2. The IELTS-relevant subset

The 76 relevant files were classified by skill using ordered keyword rules over the file names
(first match wins, so `ielts-prep` acts as the catch-all for IELTS material). The result is a
usable picture of what self-published IELTS corpora contain:

| Category                 | Files |     | Skill         | Files |
| ------------------------ | ----: | --- | ------------- | ----: |
| `ielts-writing`          |    14 |     | writing       |    17 |
| `english-reading`        |    17 |     | reading       |    20 |
| `english-reference`      |    11 |     | reference     |    11 |
| `ielts-vocabulary`       |     9 |     | vocabulary    |     9 |
| `ielts-speaking`         |     8 |     | speaking      |     9 |
| `ielts-prep`             |     4 |     | general       |     4 |
| `ielts-grammar`          |     4 |     | grammar       |     4 |
| `ielts-reading`          |     3 |     | listening     |     1 |
| `english-writing`        |     3 |     | pronunciation |     1 |
| `ielts-listening`        |     1 |     |               |       |
| `english-pronunciation`  |     1 |     |               |       |
| `english-ielts-adjacent` |     1 |     |               |       |

Two findings shaped the API:

- **Writing dominates; listening is nearly absent.** The single listening item
  (`雅思听力1000词`, 758 KB) is a vocabulary list, not audio. Any IELTS resource built from this
  corpus inherits that bias, so this API does not claim to cover listening comprehension.
- **Vocabulary is the only structured asset.** Everything except `1-22yas.xlsx` is prose, images or
  audio inside a proprietary container. Extracting clean data from 244 multipart `.rar` files of
  scanned textbooks is not a reproducible operation, and the files are third-party copyrighted
  material. They are therefore indexed (metadata only) and never redistributed.

### 3. The vocabulary dataset

`1-22yas.xlsx` (1,230,016 bytes) is the one immediately machine-readable artefact: an Office Open XML
workbook with 22 worksheets (`Chapter01` … `Chapter21`, `Sheet22`), one per Cambridge IELTS volume,
sharing a single 29,624-entry string table. Each sheet has the columns
`Number | Words | Phonetic Symbol | Explanation | Notes`; sheets 5-22 swap the `Explanation` and
`Notes` columns, so the extractor resolves columns by header rather than by position.

Extraction (`scripts/extract_vocabulary.py`, standard library only):

1. Read the shared-string table, then each worksheet, resolving column names from the header row.
2. NFC-normalise and whitespace-collapse every cell.
3. **De-duplicate** headwords case-insensitively (4,310 occurrences collapse to 4,174 unique
   headwords). Where a headword recurs, the volumes are merged and the longest gloss is kept, so a
   word keeps its richest definition instead of the first one encountered.
4. **Split senses.** 3,557 of 4,174 glosses are WordNet-style concatenations of part-of-speech-tagged
   senses (`n. ... v. ... adj. ...`). These are split on `(n|v|vt|vi|adj|adv|pron|prep|conj).`
   boundaries into a typed `senses` array; the first sense becomes the entry's `partOfSpeech` and
   `definition`. 2,980 entries (71%) are polysemous, with a mean of 4.08 senses.
5. **Normalise phonetics** to slash-delimited transcriptions (4,172 of 4,174 entries carry one).
6. **Keep morpheme hints** where published — 164 entries carry pedagogical etymologies such as
   `hydro(water);gen(create)`, which are useful for morphology-aware NLP work.
7. Emit stable identifiers (`w00001` … `w04174`) assigned after sorting by headword, so identifiers
   never move between releases.

| Property                                    |                        Value |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------: |
| Unique headwords                            |                        4,174 |
| Occurrences                                 |                        4,310 |
| Cambridge IELTS volumes                     |                         1-22 |
| With phonetic transcription                 |                        4,172 |
| With morpheme hints                         |                          164 |
| Polysemous entries                          |                        2,980 |
| Mean senses per entry                       |                         4.08 |
| Noun / verb / adjective / adverb / untagged | 2,547 / 521 / 436 / 53 / 617 |

CI re-derives the dataset from the upstream blob and fails the build if the committed JSON differs,
so the published numbers cannot silently drift.

### 4. What the API adds, and what it deliberately does not

The API publishes **metadata only** for the 76 indexed files: path, normalised title, category,
skill, format, size, blob SHA-1 and a public URL. No upstream binary is mirrored. The upstream files
are third-party copyrighted material; indexing their metadata is a descriptive act and is published
under CC BY 4.0 with attribution, while the files themselves stay with their owners.

The value added by this project is therefore in the _derived_ layer, all of it original work:

- the normalised, sense-split, volume-linked vocabulary dataset;
- condensed, original-language band descriptors (the official descriptors are not reproduced: a
  paraphrase keeps the artefact redistributable and citing the official text remains the researcher's
  obligation, which the API states on every page);
- indicative score concordances compiled from the providers' published tables, with provenance and a
  caveat in every response;
- original Writing and Speaking task banks modelled on the question families that recur in the
  corpus;
- a catalogue of preparation resources restricted to ones that are free **and** require no login.

### 5. Threats to validity (Part I)

- **Provenance of the glosses is unknown.** The workbook's definitions are short dictionary-style
  glosses of unverifiable origin; they are republished as-is and should be treated as a convenience
  layer, not as an authoritative lexical resource.
- **Phonetics are inconsistent.** Transcriptions mix IPA conventions across volumes and only two
  entries lack one entirely; they are published unmodified rather than silently "corrected".
- **File-name classification is heuristic.** A title such as _IELTS Grammar Masterclass 8.5_ is
  unambiguous, but the catch-all `ielts-prep` bucket absorbs four general books whose dominant skill
  is a matter of opinion. The rules are published in `scripts/extract_corpus.py` and every item keeps
  its raw path so a reviewer can reclassify.
- **Band descriptors are paraphrases.** They are calibrated for teaching and for machine-readable
  lookup, not for official scoring.
- **Concordances are indicative.** Providers revise their tables, and institutions apply their own.

### 6. Reproducing Part I

```bash
curl -sL "https://api.github.com/repos/zhengyishiming/IELTS/git/trees/main?recursive=1" -o tree.json
python3 scripts/extract_corpus.py tree.json data/corpus.json

curl -fsSL -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3.raw" \
  "https://api.github.com/repos/zhengyishiming/IELTS/git/blobs/d66fded8b74057a96a677eb25d9b9f7b39965ce3" \
  -o 1-22yas.xlsx
python3 scripts/extract_vocabulary.py 1-22yas.xlsx data/vocabulary.json
```

The commit SHA recorded in `data/corpus.json` identifies the exact snapshot; re-running against a
different commit is expected to change the item count and the coverage ratio.

## Part II — the practice-test collection

**Collection snapshot:** [`ngoclong1209/UPGRADE-YOUR-IELTS-SKILLS`](https://github.com/ngoclong1209/UPGRADE-YOUR-IELTS-SKILLS),
commit `ba7a0f2bf13be89c601bab2f9e72d1007f49bb2c` (3 July 2026), 60 commits, 6,309 blobs.

### 7. What the collection contains

Where Part I is a flat dump of books, this collection is an operating study product: three practice
corpora, a static web front end per item, and a Google Apps Script login that gates the whole thing
behind a 1,599,000 VND annual subscription. Its structure is:

| Directory                 | Items                             | Per-item files                                                              |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Reading_315_FullTest/`   | 315 full academic reading tests   | `Test_N.json`, `Test_N.html`, `Test_N.docx`, figures, `strategies.json`     |
| `Listening_204_FullTest/` | 204 full listening tests          | `Test_N.json`, `index.html`, `audio_N.mp3` (≈20 MB each), `strategies.json` |
| `Reading_1232_Basic/`     | 1,232 CEFR-graded reading lessons | `lesson_NNN.json` plus a shared single-page front end                       |

Three properties of the collection decide what can responsibly be published from it:

1. **The test content is not the publisher's to license.** The full tests are transcriptions of
   Cambridge-style examination material, and the repository ships a committed `.env`, a committed
   `node_modules/` and hard-coded credentials — it is a scrape, not a licensed corpus. No passage,
   question, answer key, transcript or recording is therefore redistributed here.
2. **The structural annotation is machine-readable and genuinely useful.** Every JSON item carries
   sections, per-question type labels and question-number ranges. That layer is factual metadata
   about the item, and aggregating it produces information that exists nowhere else in public: an
   empirical question-type distribution over 27,225 IELTS practice questions.
3. **The annotation vocabulary is inconsistent.** 65 distinct free-text labels are used for what are,
   in the published task descriptions, 13 task families (`diagram_labelling`, `diagram_labeling`,
   `diagram_label_completion`, `diagram_completion`, `labeling`, `map_labeling`, `map_labelling`,
   `map_matching`, `plan_labeling` and `matching_diagram` are all the same task). Normalising them is
   the first contribution of Part II.

### 8. The question-type taxonomy

`scripts/extract_practice_tests.py` maps every upstream label onto the canonical taxonomy served by
`/v1/question-types`, which follows the eleven Cambridge reading task families plus the two
listening-only families (generic matching, and plan/map/diagram labelling). The mapping is published
in full in `data/practice-tests.json` under `stats.rawLabels`, with the frequency of each raw label,
so a reviewer can re-map any decision. The label spread per canonical type is itself a measure of how
noisy free-text annotation of item types becomes at scale:

| Canonical type                    | Upstream labels merged | Questions | Share |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------: | --------: | ----: |
| `summary-completion`              |                     20 |     7,435 | 27.3% |
| `multiple-choice`                 |                      1 |     5,160 | 19.0% |
| `true-false-not-given`            |                      3 |     3,522 | 12.9% |
| `matching-information`            |                      7 |     1,985 |  7.3% |
| `yes-no-not-given`                |                      2 |     1,981 |  7.3% |
| `matching`                        |                      1 |     1,766 |  6.5% |
| `matching-headings`               |                      1 |     1,467 |  5.4% |
| `sentence-completion`             |                      3 |     1,320 |  4.8% |
| `short-answer`                    |                      4 |     1,075 |  3.9% |
| `matching-features`               |                      6 |       698 |  2.6% |
| `diagram-label-completion`        |                     10 |       493 |  1.8% |
| `multiple-choice-multiple-answer` |                      4 |       178 |  0.7% |
| `matching-sentence-endings`       |                      3 |       145 |  0.5% |

The distribution differs sharply by paper, which is the pedagogically interesting result: completion
tasks dominate listening (58.5% of 8,007 listening questions), while reading spreads across
identification and matching tasks (18.3% True/False/Not Given, 17.2% multiple choice, 14.3%
completion, 10.3% matching information, 10.3% Yes/No/Not Given). A candidate who trains only on
reading material therefore practises almost none of the task family that accounts for the majority of
the listening paper.

Question counts are parsed from the upstream `q_numbers` labels, which are free text (`7`, `1-5`,
`14 - 18`, `Questions 27-30`): ranges are expanded, lists are counted, unparseable labels count as
one question. 365 of the 470 indexed full tests come to exactly 40 questions, which is the expected
value for a complete paper and the main evidence that the parser is sound.

### 9. Passage readability

For every item with a written passage, the extractor computes running words, sentences, distinct
word forms, mean sentence length, mean syllables per word, type-token ratio, Flesch Reading Ease and
the Flesch-Kincaid grade level. Only summary statistics are published, never the text. Syllables use
the standard vowel-group heuristic with a silent-final-`e` correction, which is what the formulae
were calibrated on; readability is deliberately **not** computed for listening items, whose
`passage_or_context` fields hold timestamped transcript fragments and rubric text rather than prose.

| Group                  | Items | Mean words | Mean Flesch Reading Ease | Mean Flesch-Kincaid grade | Mean type-token ratio |
| ---------------------- | ----: | ---------: | -----------------------: | ------------------------: | --------------------: |
| Graded lessons `A1-A2` |   198 |        253 |                     70.2 |                       5.8 |                 0.543 |
| Graded lessons `B1-B2` |   374 |        242 |                     26.0 |                      13.9 |                 0.633 |
| Graded lessons `C1-C2` |   660 |        275 |                      5.0 |                      17.8 |                 0.644 |
| Full reading tests     |   269 |      2,642 |                     43.5 |                      12.6 |                 0.388 |

Two findings follow, and both are usable by anyone building graded material:

- **The CEFR ordering holds, but the calibration does not.** Reading ease falls monotonically across
  the three graded tiers, so the tiers are ordered correctly. Their absolute difficulty, however, is
  far above the CEFR labels: a B1-B2 tier averaging Flesch-Kincaid grade 13.9 is undergraduate prose,
  not independent-user prose, and the C1-C2 tier at grade 17.8 is harder than the real reading papers
  it prepares candidates for (grade 12.6). Generated "graded readers" over-shoot their target level,
  and they over-shoot it hardest in the middle of the scale.
- **Length, not lexical density, separates practice lessons from real papers.** The full tests average
  2,642 words against roughly 250 for a graded lesson, but their type-token ratio is _lower_ (0.388
  against 0.54-0.64) — the long passages recycle vocabulary, and short lessons cannot train the
  stamina the real paper demands, however hard their sentences are.

### 10. What the API publishes from Part II

- `/v1/tests`, `/v1/tests/stats`, `/v1/tests/items`, `/v1/tests/:id` — 1,702 indexed items
  (269 reading full tests, 201 listening full tests, 1,232 graded lessons; 97.3% of the upstream
  items that ship machine-readable structure) with structure, normalised question types, asset
  availability, readability statistics, upstream path, blob SHA-1 and permalink.
- `/v1/question-types`, `/v1/question-types/:id` — the 13-family taxonomy with original strategy
  guidance, the traps each family sets, and the observed frequencies above.
- `/v1/topics/themes` — the 50 recurring exam themes the collection organises its material around,
  in 11 groups, with original keyword sets.

### 11. Threats to validity (Part II)

- **The upstream annotation is not authoritative.** Type labels and question ranges were written by
  the collection's own extraction scripts, not by an examining board; the frequencies describe _this
  corpus_, which is a large convenience sample of practice material, not the live examination.
- **Normalisation merges genuine distinctions.** Folding `table_completion`, `note_completion`,
  `flow_chart_completion` and `fill_in_blank` into one `summary-completion` family follows the
  published task descriptions, but a study of gap-fill sub-types would need the raw labels, which is
  exactly why `stats.rawLabels` is published.
- **Readability formulae are proxies.** Flesch measures depend on sentence and syllable counting
  heuristics and ignore syntax, cohesion and topic familiarity; they order texts usefully but do not
  measure comprehension difficulty directly.
- **Partial coverage.** 46 reading and 3 listening test directories ship only HTML, so they are
  counted in the upstream totals but not indexed. One graded lesson is malformed JSON upstream and is
  skipped by the parser.
- **The snapshot is mutable.** The upstream repository has no tags and force-pushes are possible; the
  commit SHA and per-file blob SHA-1s recorded in `data/practice-tests.json` are what pin the
  analysis.

The script is standard library only and deterministic: the same tree and the same files always
produce byte-identical output.

## Part III — the text-analysis engine

Version 1.2.0 turns the service from a _data_ API into a _measurement_ API: `/v1/analyze/text`
accepts a pasted candidate text (an essay draft, a transcript, a reading passage) and returns a
deterministic set of descriptive statistics. Nothing is sampled, trained or inferred from a model,
so the same input always produces the same output, on every replica and every release — the
property that makes the numbers citable.

### 13. Design decisions

- **One measurement vocabulary for the whole API.** The syllable heuristic (vowel groups with a
  silent-final-`e` correction), the Flesch family constants and the tokeniser mirror
  `scripts/extract_practice_tests.py`, so a passage fetched through `/v1/tests` scores identically
  when pasted into `/v1/analyze/text`. Where the engine deliberately refines the pipeline — Unicode
  letters instead of ASCII-only words, accent folding before matching — the difference is
  documented in `/v1/analyze/reference`.
- **Sentence counting.** A sentence ends at a run of `.`, `!` or `?` followed by whitespace or the
  end of the text; a trailing sentence without a terminator still counts. This adds the
  final-sentence case to the rule used for the practice-test index; mid-text counts stay identical.
- **Six readability formulae, not one.** Flesch Reading Ease (Flesch 1948), Flesch-Kincaid grade
  (Kincaid et al. 1975), Gunning Fog (complex = 3+ syllables), SMOG (McLaughlin 1969), Coleman-Liau
  (1975) and the Automated Readability Index (Smith & Senter 1967) are reported together with their
  median ("consensus grade"), because any single formula is fragile against tailoring — dense
  academic prose scores wildly apart across formulae, and reporting the spread is more honest than
  hiding it.
- **Lexical diversity beyond raw TTR.** Raw type-token ratio falls mechanically with text length,
  so the engine also reports root TTR (Guiraud) and the Measure of Textual Lexical Diversity
  (MTLD), computed bidirectionally with the standard 0.72 factor threshold and averaged, following
  the original definition (McCarthy & Jarvis 2010). A text that never completes a factor reports
  its token count, the documented upper bound.
- **Form-exact vocabulary matching.** Coverage is computed against the 4,174 Cambridge IELTS 1-22
  headwords with case- and accent-insensitive, form-exact matching: no stemming, no lemmatisation.
  `governments` only matches if the inflected form is itself a published headword. This
  underestimates true coverage slightly but is fully deterministic and reproducible with a
  dictionary, which no stemmer can promise.
- **Three disjoint tiers.** Headwords recurring in at least two Cambridge volumes (133 words) form
  the `cross-volume` tier — the demonstrably recurring exam vocabulary; single-volume headwords
  (4,041 words) the `single-volume` tier; everything else `out-of-list`. The frequency-ranked
  out-of-list digest (ties broken alphabetically) is capped at ten words.
- **A labelled heuristic, never a score.** The consensus grade maps to a CEFR level through a
  documented threshold table (≤4 → A2, ≤6 → B1, ≤9 → B2, ≤12 → C1, else C2), and the band range is
  the span of IELTS bands that carry that level on `/v1/bands` (e.g. B2 → 5.0-6.5). Task response,
  argument quality and grammatical accuracy are not measured, so every response carries an explicit
  caveat. Band **prediction** belongs to trained models; the API deliberately ships none.

### 14. Validation anchors

The unit suite pins the engine to hand-checkable anchors, for example "The quick brown fox jumps
over the lazy dog. The dog barked loudly." (13 words, 2 sentences, 17 heuristic syllables) must
score Flesch Reading Ease 89.61, Flesch-Kincaid 2.38, Coleman-Liau 3.62, consensus 2.6 → A2, and a
dense three-sentence academic text (21 words, 70 syllables, 13 polysyllabic) must score consensus
27.56 → C2. MTLD is pinned on constructed inputs: ten identical tokens produce five closed factors
(MTLD 2), ten distinct tokens produce none (MTLD 10).

### 15. Reviewed and not imported: the self-study notes collection

[`Oxidaner/ielts`](https://github.com/Oxidaner/ielts) (snapshot `738c6082`, 2,385 blobs, no
licence file) is a Chinese self-study notebook organised by skill (作文 writing, 口语 speaking,
听力 listening, 阅读 reading, 经验 experience). It aggregates community preparation material —
Simon-method writing templates and 顾家北 phrase banks, situation-classified speaking cue-card
banks (e.g. the "神奇题库" 2025 Sep-Dec set), listening scene-vocabulary and synonym-substitution
lists, and full listening transcripts — exactly the categories that dominate exam-prep forums.

It was reviewed end to end and **deliberately not indexed**: the repository redistributes
commercial preparation material whose licence status the snapshot cannot establish, and importing
it would contradict the project's provenance rule (index and measure, never redistribute). More
substantively, its thematic categories — cue-card families, writing task archetypes, listening
scene vocabulary — are already covered by the original, openly-licensed banks served through
`/v1/topics/*` and `/v1/topics/themes`. The review motivates one tracked future work item: an
openly-licensed listening scene-vocabulary taxonomy (rental, campus, library, travel, ...) as a
companion coverage profile to the Cambridge tiers.

### 16. Threats to validity (Part III)

- **Heuristic syllabification.** Vowel-group counting disagrees with dictionaries on suffixes
  (`-tion`, `-ed`, synced forms); it is the same trade-off the classic formulae were calibrated
  with, and the dataset index uses it identically.
- **Punctuation boundaries.** Abbreviations (`e.g.`) split sentences; decimals do not count as
  words. Counts are deterministic, not linguistically perfect.
- **Readability is not difficulty.** The formulae ignore cohesion, syntax depth and topic
  familiarity; the consensus grade orders texts usefully but must not be read as an assessment
  score — which is why the band estimate ships as a labelled range with a caveat.
- **Form-exact matching undercounts coverage.** Inflected headwords match no lemma family; the
  direction of the error is documented and stable.
- **CEFR thresholds are ours.** The grade-to-CEFR table is a documented design choice, not a
  standard; `/v1/analyze/reference` publishes it so clients can re-map.
