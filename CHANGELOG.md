# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.0] - 2026-09-05

Third dataset family: the self-study notes collection
[`Oxidaner/ielts`](https://github.com/Oxidaner/ielts) — a 4.8 GB personal IELTS study archive — is
analysed, indexed and mined. As with the research corpus and the practice-test collection, only
derived, non-substitutive metadata, counts and short collocations are published: no upstream
document, recording, model answer or question text is redistributed.

### Added

- **Self-study collection index** (`data/study-notes.json`, 2,353 of 2,385 upstream files):
  skill, category, format, size, blob SHA-1 and permalink for every file, plus aggregate
  composition statistics and derived counts of the seasonal speaking question bank shipped inside
  the collection (18 Part 1 topics, 79 Part 1 questions, 22 Part 2 cue cards, 121 Part 3 follow-up
  questions, season 2025-09..12). Endpoints: `/v1/notes`, `/v1/notes/stats`, `/v1/notes/items`.
- **Speaking argumentative collocation bank** (`data/collocations.json`, 245 phrases): English
  collocations and sentence frames mined from Part I of the collection's Speaking Part 3
  methodology note, each tagged with its argumentative dimension (14 dimensions from personality
  types to nature and nurture), sub-group, polarity (50 positive / 45 negative / 149 neutral) and
  the original Chinese gloss (240 of 245 entries). Endpoints: `/v1/collocations`,
  `/v1/collocations/stats`, `/v1/collocations/dimensions`, `/v1/collocations/items`,
  `/v1/collocations/random`.
- `scripts/extract_study_notes.py` and `scripts/extract_collocations.py`: standard-library-only,
  deterministic extraction from an upstream tree listing and a sparse checkout.
- `RESEARCH.md` Part III: the collection analysis (audio-heavy composition, third-party material
  share, category distribution), the question-bank counts, the collocation mining methodology, the
  cross-listing finding (9 phrases taught under more than one dimension) and the threats to
  validity that apply to all of it.

### Changed

- `/` and `/health` report the new dataset sizes (`studyNotesFiles`, `speakingBankQuestions`,
  `collocationPhrases`, `collocationDimensions`); `/health` checks the two new datasets.
- The OpenAPI document, the README dataset table and the endpoint index cover the new routes.
- Test suite grown to 385 tests, still at 100% statement, branch, function and line coverage per
  file.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-09-05

Second dataset family: the practice-test collection
[`ngoclong1209/UPGRADE-YOUR-IELTS-SKILLS`](https://github.com/ngoclong1209/UPGRADE-YOUR-IELTS-SKILLS)
is analysed, normalised and indexed. As with the research corpus, only derived metadata and
statistics are published — no passage, question, answer key, transcript or recording is
redistributed.

### Added

- **Practice-test index** (`data/practice-tests.json`, 1,702 items, 27,225 questions): structure,
  normalised question types, asset availability, upstream provenance (path, blob SHA-1, permalink)
  and passage-level readability statistics (words, sentences, type-token ratio, Flesch Reading Ease,
  Flesch-Kincaid grade) for 269 full reading tests, 201 full listening tests and 1,232 CEFR-graded
  reading lessons. Endpoints: `/v1/tests`, `/v1/tests/stats`, `/v1/tests/items`, `/v1/tests/:id`.
- **Question-type taxonomy**: the 13 canonical IELTS Reading and Listening task families, each with
  original strategy guidance, the traps it sets, its answer format, and the frequency observed in the
  indexed corpus; 65 upstream free-text labels are normalised onto it. Endpoints:
  `/v1/question-types`, `/v1/question-types/:id`.
- **Exam themes**: 50 recurring themes in 11 groups with original keyword sets (`/v1/topics/themes`).
- `scripts/extract_practice_tests.py`: standard-library-only, deterministic extraction of the index
  from an upstream tree listing and a local checkout.
- `RESEARCH.md` Part II: the collection analysis, the label-normalisation table, the question-type
  distribution by paper, the readability findings (CEFR tiers are ordered correctly but calibrated
  far too hard) and the threats to validity that apply to them.

### Changed

- `/` and `/health` report the practice-test dataset sizes; `/docs` lists the new datasets.
- The OpenAPI document, the README dataset table and the endpoint index cover the new routes.
- Test suite grown to 341 tests, still at 100% statement, branch, function and line coverage per file.

### Fixed

- super-linter now installs the project's dependencies before it runs: version 8 lints TypeScript
  with this repository's own `eslint.config.js`, which cannot be loaded unless the packages it
  imports are resolvable, so the job failed before checking a single file.
- The whole tree is clean under super-linter 8 again: an unused shell loop variable (SC2034),
  Markdown and BibTeX indentation that editorconfig-checker rejected, the JOSS paper's top-level
  section headings (MD025), and the two Checkov OpenAPI policies that assume every API
  authenticates its callers — recorded, with the reason, in `.checkov.yaml`.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-04

First citable release.

### Added

- **Vocabulary dataset**: 4,174 headwords (4,310 occurrences) extracted from the Cambridge IELTS
  volumes 1-22 word lists, with phonetics, part-of-speech-tagged senses, morpheme hints and volume
  provenance. Endpoints: `/v1/vocabulary`, `/v1/vocabulary/stats`, `/v1/vocabulary/random`,
  `/v1/vocabulary/daily`, `/v1/vocabulary/:word`.
- **Band data**: the 0-9 band scale with indicative CEFR levels (`/v1/bands`), 120 condensed analytic
  band descriptors across Speaking, Writing Task 1 and Writing Task 2 (`/v1/bands/descriptors`), and
  per-band lookup (`/v1/bands/:band`).
- **Scoring**: overall-band calculation with the IELTS rounding rule (`/v1/scores/overall`),
  IELTS-to-other-scale conversion for CEFR, TOEFL iBT, Cambridge English Scale, PTE Academic and the
  Duolingo English Test (`/v1/scores/convert`), and the reverse mapping (`/v1/scores/interpret`).
- **Task banks**: 111 Writing Task 2 prompts (`/v1/topics/writing`), 80 Speaking items across Parts
  1-3 (`/v1/topics/speaking`), 10 Writing Task 1 families (`/v1/tasks/writing`).
- **Research corpus index**: metadata and statistics for the 76 IELTS-relevant files of the 404-file
  upstream corpus (`/v1/corpus`, `/v1/corpus/stats`, `/v1/corpus/items`).
- **Resource catalogue**: 27 preparation resources, restricted to free, login-free ones
  (`/v1/resources`).
- **Service endpoints**: `/`, `/v1`, `/health`, `/docs`, `/openapi.json`.
- Deterministic responses: ETags, conditional-request support, gzip compression, open CORS, seeded
  sampling.
- Reproducible data pipeline in `scripts/` (standard library only).
- Citation metadata: `CITATION.cff`, `codemeta.json`, `.zenodo.json`, `paper/paper.md`.
- 100% coverage gate, super-linter on push / pull request / weekly, CI on Node 20 and 22.
